Designing a birth and death registration system using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend involves several steps. Here's a comprehensive outline and structure:

## Project Structure

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. **Entities (Models)**
    - `Person`: Represents a person, whether for birth or death registration.
    - `BirthRecord`: Specific details about a birth record.
    - `DeathRecord`: Specific details about a death record.
    - `User`: For authentication and authorization.

2. **Repositories**
    - `PersonRepository`: CRUD operations for `Person`.
    - `BirthRecordRepository`: CRUD operations for `BirthRecord`.
    - `DeathRecordRepository`: CRUD operations for `DeathRecord`.
    - `UserRepository`: CRUD operations for `User`.

3. **Services**
    - `PersonService`: Business logic for managing persons.
    - `BirthRecordService`: Business logic for managing birth records.
    - `DeathRecordService`: Business logic for managing death records.
    - `UserService`: Business logic for managing users.

4. **Controllers**
    - `PersonController`: REST endpoints for person operations.
    - `BirthRecordController`: REST endpoints for birth record operations.
    - `DeathRecordController`: REST endpoints for death record operations.
    - `AuthController`: REST endpoints for authentication and authorization.

5. **Security**
    - Configuration for securing the application with Spring Security.
    - JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication.

6. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**
    - Transfer data between frontend and backend.

### Frontend (React)

1. **Components**
    - `PersonList`: List all persons.
    - `PersonForm`: Add or edit a person.
    - `BirthRecordForm`: Add or edit a birth record.
    - `DeathRecordForm`: Add or edit a death record.
    - `Login`: User authentication.
    - `Register`: User registration.

2. **Services**
    - `PersonService`: API calls for person operations.
    - `BirthRecordService`: API calls for birth record operations.
    - `DeathRecordService`: API calls for death record operations.
    - `AuthService`: API calls for authentication and authorization.

3. **Routing**
    - Define routes for navigating between components.

4. **State Management**
    - Use React Context or Redux for managing state.

### Database Schema

- `person`: id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, address, phone_number
- `birth_record`: id, person_id, birth_date, birth_place, parent_names
- `death_record`: id, person_id, death_date, death_place, cause_of_death
- `user`: id, username, password, role
